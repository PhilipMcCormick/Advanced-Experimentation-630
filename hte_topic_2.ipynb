Researchers want to understand whether exposing voters to information on homelessness increases their support for taxes on the wealthy. So the treatment is a binary indicator for whether the voter received information on homelessness, and the response variable is a measure of support (from 0 - 100) on raising taxes for the wealthy. The experiment will be conducted by flipping a coin before approaching each voter to determine treatment -- and so with 50% probability, the voter will be exposed to information; and with 50% probability, the voter will not.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YtQYEU4uEGll","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667269212785,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1343,"user":{"displayName":"Philip McCormick","userId":"16478560818685820008"}}},"source":["# Load libraries: numpy, pandas, and linear regression\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import statsmodels.formula.api as sm"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2k0NgoReFIGw"},"source":["Now we construct what is known as the data-generating process.
